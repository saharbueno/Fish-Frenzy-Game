# Fish-Frenzy-Game

## Description
An adorable game where you can play as your chosen kitty, aiming to catch as many fish as you can while evading the Big Bad Wolf. A single encounter with the wolf means you're caught, so the player must be swift and strategic. The user controls the kitty's movements with the WASD keys, and they must select their preferred kitty from the dropdown above before starting. There is also a feature to adjust the game difficulty with a click and the RIGHT ARROW key. This game was developed using HTML, CSS, and the p5.js library.

## Game Demo

## Process & Takeaways 
This game offered a very exciting and interesting learning experience. I had to use the Object Oriented Programming aspect of JS in order to create classes for each object like the kitty, wolf, and all the fish. Each of these classes have constructors and functions that ensure the object has what it needs to operate as it should.
